Welcome
=======

This is a place for members of the community to collaborate on making i2p *applications* easier to use and more available to all, by packaging them so they can be easily used in Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distributions. It is intended to stimulate interest in community participation, application development, and the [I2P Labs project](https://i2pforum.net/viewforum.php?f=36.
