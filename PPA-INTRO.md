Welcome

=======


This is a place for members of the community to collaborate on making
 i2p *applications* easier to use and more available to all, by 
packaging them so they can be easily used in Ubuntu and other 
Debian-based Linux distributions. It is intended to stimulate interest 
in community participation, application development, and the [I2P Labs 
project](https://i2pforum.net/viewforum.php?f=36.


Getting Started

---------------


If you're interested in getting a copy of our applications and libraries, then this is just a normal PPA. Use it and enjoy.


    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:i2p-community/ppa

    sudo apt-get update


If you wish to access this PPA from within i2p, a proxy is available:


  * [caching proxy (i2p Link)](http://)

  * [HTTPS CONNECT proxy (i2p Link)](https://)


If you're interested in getting involved or developing an i2p application of your own, get in touch with us at


  * [I2P Forums (i2p link)](https://i2pforum.i2p)

  * [I2P Forums](https://i2pforum.net)

  * [I2P on Github](https://github.com/i2p/)


Or here, on launchpad if you work here as well. Other communication channels might be added as they become needed.
